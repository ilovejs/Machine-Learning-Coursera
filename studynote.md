    *   review before proceed
    *   learn from examples / applications
        *   neural network, multiple features
*   review
    *   interesting bio-mimic
        *   example of using other sensory and learn

*   review question
    *   multi-class classification output (The outputs of a neural network are not probabilities, so their sum need not be 1.)
*   programming exercise
    *   neural network
        *   activation don't forget sigmoid function
### Week3 Logistic Regression & Regularization
####    Logistic Regression
- ->  problem of Linear Regression for classification
- ->  Logistic Regression (change expression of hypothesis)
- ->  Sigmoid Function (Logistic function) & Decision Boundary
- ->  Cost Function (non-convex -> convex)
- ->  simplify Cost Function, Gradient Descent
- ->  * Advanced Optimization
    *   fminunc
    *   Optimization Algorithm: Gradient descent, Conjugate gradient, BFGS  , L-BFGS
- ->  Multiclass Classification: one vs all
*   Question
    *   1/2m in Cost Function of Linear Regression, where does 1/2 come from?
    *   Logistic Regression Gradient 求导 (形式与Linear Regression相似)
####    Regularization
->  overfitting / underfitting
->  regularized Linear / Logistic Regression
-   normal equation

*   Question
    *   lamda 如何选取, weighted?
    *   lamda 在 normal equation 中
####    Programming Exercise
*   plotting
    *   find index, plot, mark legend in the same order as plot
### Week2
